# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

## Login Functionality
This repository now includes a login functionality. The `index.html` file contains a login form with `username` and `password` fields. The server-side logic for handling login requests is implemented in the `login.js` file.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the server by running `node login.js`.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
5. Enter your username and password in the login form and click the "Login" button.
